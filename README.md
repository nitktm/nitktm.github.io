This is a single-page layout for easier access.

Contributing guidelines:

1) All CSS, JS, and image files go into `assets/(css or js or images)`.
2) All SCSS (Sass) files go into `_sass`.
3) To import stylesheets, add it to `_pages/head_tag.html`. Similarly, for scripts, add it to `_pages/body_tag.html`.
4) Changes to the header and footer can be made in `_pages/header.html` and `_pages/footer.html`.
5) Currently `index.html` has multiple sections. The aim is to split the sections into its own files for easier maintainence and code readability.
6) A layout/modal for posts will come soon.
7) Asset imports will be shifted to CDN links soon.
